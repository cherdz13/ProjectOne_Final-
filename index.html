        <p>I'm from East Los Angeles, I have two orange cats. They are calm but very chaotic; it's fun to see them play and interact with bugs. I have a dog named Rocky; both cats don't like how clingy and rough he can be with them. My favorite colors are green and burgundy. I also have a wide range of interests, but I love being creative and having the liberty to express myself.</p>
